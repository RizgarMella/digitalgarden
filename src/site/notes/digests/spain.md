## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Spain’s current performance and future trajectory in four critical dual-use technology domains: **3d-printing**, **edge-computing**, **quantum-key-distribution**, and **smart-materials**. The analysis focuses on the activities and capabilities of four Spanish organisations: [[cetemmsa\|Cetemmsa]], [[luxquanta\|LuxQuanta]], [[Nearby Computing\|Nearby Computing]], and [[ziknes\|Ziknes]]. Spain has made notable progress in these areas, leveraging a combination of public investment, EU funding, and a growing ecosystem of research and industrial partners. However, challenges remain in scaling innovation, bridging gaps between research and deployment, and ensuring competitiveness on the global stage. The next five years present both significant opportunities for Spain to strengthen its position and risks that must be carefully managed.

## Weaknesses

### Limited Scale-Up Capacity

While Spain excels in R&D and prototyping, it faces challenges in scaling innovations to mass production and commercialisation. This is particularly evident in [[3d-printing\|3d-printing]] and [[smart-materials\|smart-materials]], where pilot projects often struggle to reach industrial maturity.

### Fragmented Ecosystem

The Spanish dual-use technology ecosystem remains fragmented, with insufficient coordination between academia, industry, and government. This can result in duplicated efforts and missed opportunities for cross-sectoral innovation, especially in rapidly evolving fields like [[edge-computing\|edge-computing]] and [[quantum-key-distribution\|quantum-key-distribution]].

### Dependence on Foreign Technology

Spain’s supply chains for advanced manufacturing equipment, quantum hardware, and specialised materials are still reliant on imports, primarily from Germany, the US, and China. This dependence creates vulnerabilities in the context of global supply chain disruptions or geopolitical tensions.

### Talent Retention Issues

Despite a strong educational base, Spain struggles to retain top talent in high-demand fields such as quantum engineering, AI, and advanced manufacturing. Brain drain to other EU countries and the US remains a concern, limiting the growth potential of organisations like [[luxquanta\|LuxQuanta]] and [[Nearby Computing\|Nearby Computing]].

Spain, through [[luxquanta\|LuxQuanta]] and national initiatives, will be at the forefront of QKD deployment in Southern Europe. Pilot projects are likely to mature into operational systems for government and critical infrastructure, positioning Spain as a regional hub for quantum-secure communications. Continued investment and international collaboration will be essential to maintain momentum.

### Smart-Materials

Spanish RTOs, led by [[cetemmsa\|Cetemmsa]], will drive innovation in [[smart-materials\|smart-materials]] for dual-use applications, including adaptive camouflage, lightweight armour, and embedded sensors. The main challenge will be scaling laboratory breakthroughs to industrial and military deployment, requiring closer collaboration with end-users and integrators.

### Overall Trajectory

Spain’s dual-use technology sector is poised for moderate but sustained growth, underpinned by strong R&D capabilities, EU integration, and a growing cohort of innovative SMEs. Success will depend on addressing scale-up and coordination challenges, retaining talent, and leveraging international partnerships. If these issues are managed effectively, Spain can secure a leading role in the European dual-use technology landscape by 2030, with significant export and collaboration opportunities.
