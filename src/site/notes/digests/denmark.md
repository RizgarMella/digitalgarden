## Outlook (5-year)

### Biodegradable-Plastics

Denmark is expected to consolidate its position as a European leader in research and high-value applications of **biodegradable-plastics**. Over the next five years, increased investment in pilot-scale manufacturing, public procurement, and cross-sector partnerships will drive the transition from laboratory innovation to commercial deployment. Denmark’s focus on circular economy principles and environmental leadership will support export growth, particularly in niche markets such as defence logistics, medical devices, and specialty packaging.

However, Denmark will need to address scale and cost barriers to compete with larger producers. Continued participation in EU programmes and Nordic collaborations will be vital for market expansion and standardisation. By 2030, Denmark could emerge as a key supplier of advanced biodegradable materials for high-performance and regulated applications, provided it sustains R&D momentum and industrial investment.

### Quantum-Key-Distribution

Denmark’s trajectory in **quantum-key-distribution** is highly promising but contingent on sustained investment and infrastructure development. The next five years will see the maturation of national and cross-border quantum communication networks, with Danish research institutions and start-ups playing pivotal roles in technology development and standard-setting.

[[Sparrow Quantum\|Sparrow Quantum]] and the [[University of Copenhagen\|University of Copenhagen]] are well-positioned to lead in photonic quantum technologies, with potential for commercial breakthroughs in single-photon sources and integrated quantum cryptography solutions. Defence and critical infrastructure applications will expand, supported by pilot projects and EU collaboration.

To maintain competitiveness, Denmark must address talent retention, accelerate commercialisation, and deepen integration with European and NATO quantum initiatives. By 2030, Denmark could be recognised as a regional hub for quantum-secure communications and a key contributor to the European quantum technology ecosystem.
