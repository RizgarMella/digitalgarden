## Executive Summary

India’s dual-use technology sector has witnessed significant momentum as of mid-2025, driven by a confluence of public policy support, a vibrant startup ecosystem, and growing demand from both civilian and defence sectors. This report examines India’s performance and trajectory in seven key dual-use technologies—artificial-intelligence, biometric-authentication-systems, internet-of-things-iot, predictive-maintenance, quantum-key-distribution, sensors, and wearable-health-tech—through the lens of leading domestic organisations: [[Infinite Uptime\|Infinite Uptime]], [[otpless\|OTPless]], [[pixxel\|Pixxel]], [[QNu Labs\|QNu Labs]], [[Sarvam AI\|Sarvam AI]], [[ultrahuman\|Ultrahuman]], and [[Zypp Electric\|Zypp Electric]]. 

India’s strengths lie in its cost-effective innovation, robust talent pool, and increasing integration of indigenous solutions into critical infrastructure and defence. However, challenges remain in scaling, deeptech R&D, and bridging the gap between commercial and military-grade requirements. Strategic investments, public-private partnerships, and international collaborations are shaping the current landscape, with notable advancements in quantum security, AI, and IoT-enabled platforms.

Looking ahead, India is poised to consolidate its position as a leading provider of dual-use technologies, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, provided it addresses key weaknesses and leverages opportunities for collaboration and export.
