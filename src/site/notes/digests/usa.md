**Date:** 2025-06-08

---

## Executive Summary

The United States maintains a leading global position in the research, development, and deployment of dual-use technologies, particularly in areas such as [[descriptions/artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]], [[descriptions/quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[descriptions/robotics\|robotics]], [[descriptions/additive-manufacturing\|additive-manufacturing]] (including [[descriptions/3d-printing\|3d-printing]] and [[descriptions/3d-printing-for-manufacturing\|3d-printing-for-manufacturing]]), [[descriptions/cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]], and [[descriptions/sustainable-materials\|sustainable-materials]]. The nation’s innovation ecosystem is driven by a robust combination of world-class universities, advanced research institutes, agile startups, and established technology firms, many of which are included in the organisations reviewed in this report.

The U.S. government, through both direct investment and policy initiatives, continues to prioritize these dual-use technologies for their critical role in national security, economic competitiveness, and industrial modernization. However, challenges persist, including supply chain vulnerabilities, talent shortages, regulatory uncertainty, and intensifying global competition—particularly from China and the European Union.

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the United States’ current performance and trajectory across key dual-use technologies, referencing the contributions of leading organisations and highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.

The U.S. leads in the development of [[descriptions/smart-manufacturing\|smart-manufacturing]] platforms and the adoption of [[descriptions/sustainable-materials\|sustainable-materials]].

---

## Weaknesses

### 1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Despite domestic innovation, the U.S. remains dependent on foreign suppliers for critical components (e.g., rare earths, advanced semiconductors, specialty chemicals) necessary for [[descriptions/quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[descriptions/smart-sensors\|smart-sensors]], and [[descriptions/robotics\|robotics]]. This creates potential chokepoints in the event of geopolitical disruption.

### 2. Talent Shortages

There is a persistent shortage of STEM talent, particularly in [[descriptions/quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[descriptions/artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]], and [[descriptions/cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]]. While top universities produce world-class graduates, demand outpaces supply, and immigration policies have sometimes limited access to global talent.

### 3. Regulatory and Ethical Uncertainty

Rapid advances in AI (e.g., [[organisations/anthropic\|Anthropic]], [[Virtue AI\|Virtue AI]]), [[descriptions/biomimicry\|biomimicry]], and [[descriptions/blockchain\|blockchain]] (e.g., [[organisations/consensys\|Consensys]], [[Unstoppable Domains\|Unstoppable Domains]]) outpace regulatory frameworks, creating uncertainty for dual-use applications. Issues around privacy, data use, and export controls can slow innovation and market adoption.

### 4. Fragmented Technology Transition

While basic research is strong, transitioning technologies from lab to fielded systems remains a challenge. Startups and university spinouts often face “valleys of death” in scaling and securing government contracts, despite programs like AFWERX and DIU.

### 5. International Competition

China and the EU are rapidly closing the gap in [[descriptions/quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[descriptions/artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]], [[descriptions/robotics\|robotics]], and [[descriptions/sustainable-materials\|sustainable-materials]], often leveraging state subsidies, coordinated industrial policy, and aggressive talent recruitment.
