## Weaknesses

### 1. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Despite domestic innovation, the U.S. remains dependent on foreign suppliers for critical components (e.g., rare earths, advanced semiconductors, specialty chemicals) necessary for [[quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[smart-sensors\|smart-sensors]], and [[robotics\|robotics]]. This creates potential chokepoints in the event of geopolitical disruption.

### 2. Talent Shortages

There is a persistent shortage of STEM talent, particularly in [[quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]], and [[cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]]. While top universities produce world-class graduates, demand outpaces supply, and immigration policies have sometimes limited access to global talent.

Issues around privacy, data use, and export controls can slow innovation and market adoption.

### 4. Fragmented Technology Transition

While basic research is strong, transitioning technologies from lab to fielded systems remains a challenge. Startups and university spinouts often face “valleys of death” in scaling and securing government contracts, despite programs like AFWERX and DIU.

### 5. International Competition

China and the EU are rapidly closing the gap in [[quantum-computing\|quantum-computing]], [[artificial-intelligence\|artificial-intelligence]], [[robotics\|robotics]], and [[sustainable-materials\|sustainable-materials]], often leveraging state subsidies, coordinated industrial policy, and aggressive talent recruitment.
