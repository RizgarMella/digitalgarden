## Risks & Mitigation

### Technology Leakage and IP Risks

Given the dual-use nature of these technologies, there is a heightened risk of intellectual property (IP) theft and technology leakage, particularly to strategic competitors. Japan’s export control regime is robust, but enforcement and cybersecurity must be continually strengthened. Mitigation strategies include enhanced vetting of foreign partners, investment in cybersecurity, and participation in multilateral export control regimes.

### Geopolitical Tensions

Rising tensions in East Asia, particularly with China and North Korea, increase the risk of supply chain disruptions and targeted cyberattacks. Japan should diversify supply chains, stockpile critical materials, and invest in cyber resilience for dual-use technology firms.

### Talent Shortages

The shortage of advanced digital talent poses a long-term risk. Mitigation requires investment in STEM education, incentives for foreign talent, and upskilling programs for existing workers.

### Regulatory Bottlenecks

Slow regulatory adaptation can impede innovation and deployment. Japan should streamline approval processes for emerging technologies and create regulatory sandboxes for rapid prototyping and testing.

### Aging Infrastructure

To avoid obsolescence, Japan must invest in upgrading manufacturing and R&D infrastructure, particularly for [[3d-printing\|3d-printing]] and [[edge-computing\|edge-computing]]. Public-private partnerships and targeted subsidies can accelerate modernization.
